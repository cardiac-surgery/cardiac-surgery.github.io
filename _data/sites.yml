  comment: The certs generated with CAcert are fine, but the systems used to log into CAcert may have been compromised.  Note that while the blog post is dated the 8th, the list of fixed systems is made in an undated update to the original post; we know the update was in place by the 10th.

  blogpost: https://cardiac-surgery.github.io/evidence/comodo
  developer: true
  comment: Comodo avoid mentioning whether or not their own systems, through which certificates are ordered, were vulnerable, thus the lack of a ‘safe’ status.  Also beware the “no-charge reissue policy” claim, as they do <em>not</em> claim no-charge for revoking the old certificate, which remains necessary and one reseller has reported problems trying to persuade Comodo to waive the fees for that.

  comment: RapidSSL avoid mentioning whether or not their own systems, through which certificates are ordered, were vulnerable, thus the lack of a ‘safe’ status.  Much like Comodo, RapidSSL carefully claim “Replacements are free for the lifetime of the certificate”  but do <em>not</em> make this free claim for the cost of revoking the old certificate.
