Hello,

At Leap Motion, we take your account security very seriously. On Tuesday, we were informed of a major vulnerability, dubbed Heartbleed, within one of the Internet’s main security protocols. A great number of services across the internet – including Airspace – may have been affected by this issue.

Since learning of the vulnerability, we’ve been taking the proper measures to ensure the security of Airspace, and the bug has been patched. Our customers’ payment information, including credit card numbers, were not affected by the bug. We also have no indication that any data was compromised.

Nonetheless, we encourage you to change your Leap Motion account password. If you have any questions, please reach out to our customer support team.

Thanks,
Leap Motion
