Last week news broke of a major internet security vulnerability known as [Heartbleed][], which affects OpenSSL, used by a majority of the web to securely send data.  Only, maybe, not so securely?

We want you to know that Kato is **safe** from Heartbleed.

We took a number of steps to ensure your security:

 * We patched OpenSSL on all Kato servers immediately after the Heartbleed disclosure
 * We revoked and replaced all Kato SSL keys and certificates

As a precautionary measure, please change your password in Kato.

Thanks for your trust in Kato.  We're committed to the security and privacy of your data.  If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact us.

Regards,  
The Kato team
