1Password
---------

 * <https://agilebits.com/onepassword>
 * Mac, Windows, iPhone/iPad, Android
 * Browser plugins
 * Friendly interface


LastPass
--------

 * <https://lastpass.com/>
 * Windows, Mac, Linux; iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone
 * Free, Premium and Enterprise versions.
 * Synchronization between clients, but password needed to decrypt, so the company can't access the secrets.
 * Enterprise allows for password sharing between people in an organization, with
   groups and access control lists.
 * Has tools which do a better job than most of tracking heartbleed status.
   Although it uses replacement certificate time, instead of presence on
   revocation lists, so leads to a false sense of confidence and people
   changing passwords while still talking to systems controlled by attackers,
   and some CAs are issuing replacement certs with the original start-date.
   So both false unsafe and dangerous false safe statements.
 * User interface is more geared towards power users
